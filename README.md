# Coverage Adjustment for Routine Sequence QC
This tool can be used to adjust the estimated depth of coverage that is
generated by our [BCCDC-PHL/routine-sequence-qc](https://github.com/BCCDC-PHL/routine-sequence-qc)
pipeline. It uses two additional pieces of information to make the adjustment: the name of the species
of interest, and the genome size for that species.

The two input files (`--sequence-qc` and `--abundance`) are provided by our [BCCDC-PHL/qc-stats](https://github.com/BCCDC-PHL/qc-stats) site.
